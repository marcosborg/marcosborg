# **ABOUT ME**

Programming is my passion. I dedicated myself to a more WEB-orien- ted area, as I understood that the future of programming would be in the CLOUD languages.

Today, I gather skills that allow me to carry out complex projects on my own or as part of a team.

I learned that in programming, nothing is impossible. When a professional says itâ€™s not possible, itâ€™s because he still doesnâ€™t know how to do it.
